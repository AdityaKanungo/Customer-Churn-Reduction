# Customer-Churn-Reduction
Project to develop an Machine learning algorithm to predict the churn score. 

Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving. This problem statement is targeted at enabling churn reduction using analytics concepts. Our objective is to predict customer behavior. We are provided with a public dataset that has customer usage pattern and if the customer has moved or not. We are expected to develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage pattern.
